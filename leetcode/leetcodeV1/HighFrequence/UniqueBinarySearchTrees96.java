// Given a sequence 1â€¦n, we pick a number i out of the sequence as the root, then the number of unique BST with the specified root F(i),
// is the cartesian product of the number of BST for its left and right subtrees. For example, F(3, 7):
// the number of unique BST tree with number 3 as its root. To construct an unique BST out of the entire sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] with 3 as the root, which is to say,
// we need to construct an unique BST out of its left subsequence [1, 2] and another BST out of the right subsequence [4, 5, 6, 7], and then combine them together (i.e. cartesian product).
// The tricky part is that we could consider the number of unique BST out of sequence [1,2] as G(2),
// and the number of of unique BST out of sequence [4, 5, 6, 7] as G(4). Therefore, F(3,7) = G(2) * G(4).
//i.e.
//F(i, n) = G(i-1) * G(n-i)	1 <= i <= n



    //Just treat each number as root, and then left part * right part is the answer.
